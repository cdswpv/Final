**Sports**

![Baseball](baseball.jfif)

I am a huge sports fan. I love baseball, football, and basketball, in that order.
I played baseball growing up my whole life, wasn't good enough to make any college team, so now I argue with people on twitter over stats.
My favorite baseball team is the St. Louis Cardinals, because I grew up in St. Louis, MO. 
For football and basketball, I'm only a casual fan because the sports aren't as statistical as baseball. 
But my favorite teams are the Green Bay Packers, and Boston Celtics.

I spend a lot of time and money playing games. It cost me over $1000 to build my current PC that all came out of my pocket. 
I play a lot of shooter games and solo RPG games. I even play for the *Rainbow Six: Siege* club team here at Mizzou.
