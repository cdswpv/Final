#Biography

My name is Colin Smith and I'm a freshman at Mizzou. I am 18 years old, born on May 31, 2002. 
I have lived in St. Louis, MO for all of my life, until I moved into Columbia, MO to enjoy college.

My family members are very different in their respective ways.
My mother is first-generation Hungarian, which let me take trips to Hungary all my life to visit family members.
My father went to the military straight out of high school.
My brother is the first person in my family to get a college degree, and he has been guiding me throughout my life.
I have two nonhuman family members. One being a dog named Checkers, and the other being a cat named Kitty. I know, super creative.

Currently I am on pace to graduate college in four years from now with an Information Technology degree.
