#Biography

My name is Colin Smith and I'm a freshman at Mizzou. I am 18 years old, born on May 31, 2002. 
I have lived in St. Louis, MO for all of my life, until I moved into Columbia, MO to enjoy college.
My mother is first-generation Hungarian, which let me take trips to Hungary all my life to visit family members.
