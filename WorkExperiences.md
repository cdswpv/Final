#Past Work Experiences

I've worked at plenty of stores before, three to be exact.
My first job was at a small ice cream shop called Fritz's.
My second job I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods, and I hated every second of it.
My third and current job is at Cane's and I've gone super high up the ladder.
